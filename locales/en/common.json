Each record appears in 'its' category. Currently, to select an Open Data category, the record must also be published as Open Data. This technical restriction will soon be removed by a further development of the HMDK's data entry interface. The selection of an Open Data category can then be made independently of the publication as Open Data. If no category is assigned to a data set, the data set will be displayed in the topic tree under Miscellaneous.<br/> We have chosen the Open Data categories because the data in the Transparency Portal is also sorted according to these categories and many data sets are already categorized accordingly.<br/> Alternatively, the tree can also be structured according to the INSPIRE categories.",

The folder then contains the individual map layers that are assigned to the data record (for example, requirement counting point, see figure below). (For experts: The map layers are usually named as they are called in the associated map service, i.e. as they were named in the underlying map document)<br/> If exactly one map layer is assigned to a data record, a simple entry is created in the topic tree. The simple entry is also named in the same way as the data record in the HMDK (e.g. Current construction sites, see image below).<br/> For each layer, the associated metadata for data records can be called up via the i-button (<span class=\"{{iconCls}}\"></span>).",
